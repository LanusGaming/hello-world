# hello-world

Hey guys!

My name is Patrick and im 15 years old (What a lame intro, huh?). Well, there's not much to say about me...
I programed a few things in Unity, Python, Java and Go (noone knows that one, probably...) and I'm currently learning C++ and JavaScript.
Unity is the engine I use mainly, though Python is very useful too.
You might have noticed that my English isn't striking. That's because I'm from Germany.
That isn't a proper reason, honestly. Let's just say I didn't listen in class.
So I got a bit distracked from the main topic: me
But I'm to lazy, to write anything more XD
